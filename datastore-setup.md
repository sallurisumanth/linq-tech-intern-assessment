# Datastore Setup

## Chosen Datastore:
*MongoDB* 

# Why I chose MongoDB:
MongoDB stores data in a simple, JSON-like format, which makes it flexible and easy to work with.

It integrates well with Python through the pymongo library, allowing quick and efficient setup.

It's a great fit for this project since it handles mock data like categories, values, and timestamps perfectly.

MongoDB also provides powerful aggregation pipelines for analyzing trends, filtering data, and preparing it for visualization.
